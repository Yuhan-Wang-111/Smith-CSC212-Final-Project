I started this project with no idea why we need a graph. My CSC111 project is similiar to a text-based adventure, so I was trpped in the idea to make it hardcoded with a long list of if statements. 

And then I built the MainWorld, where I used the graph just like a pre-determined if statements. It was really chunky and complicated. But through my exploration of graph and reading through the guava exmaples, I started to realize how this graph could be a useful tool to just lead people from positions to positions, and allow them to pick or drop different things at each node.

That's when I created the Puff Home and Three Flower Village. It is so much clearer and easy-to-check since I made it generalized to each node.

After the exam I took on May 5, I realized there is this thing called inheritance that could be so useful since my three classes for three worlds have a large portion that is shared. I then tried to make PuffHome and ThreeFlowerVillage inheritable. And with the advice from the checkin, I changed the help description, and added an exit function. Now I feel like everything is working well at the best level I can get now.

Graph is absolutely one of the biggest takeaway for me. And another thing I guess is the ability to use outside packages. It is a lot of reading through and testing before comfortably implementing, but when I finally made it, it's a lot of improvement.

If I had more time, or I would do this again, I would absolutely start from using this data structure, instead of putting my things in and test at the same time. The approach might be efficient, but the realization of implementations is in the middle phase, and thus making it a more effective program would need more time.

Another big thing I realized in this project is that I finally get to understand object-oriented and classes much much much better than before. When this can have little trouble, and also how I can use this to save code lines.

In the final version, I successfully employ Graph and Inheritance as two major things that largely save the code lines. I created Character and Thing classes that count for the nodes in the graph. I also created two game files to allow better debugging. I used ArrayList as one of the data structures because it can easily resize, easy add and removal, and easy locate. Other major elements include: for and while loop, if statement, exception, recursion, and many basic java methods.
